Go by Example: Directories

Go has several useful functions for working with directories in the file system.
	


Create a new sub-directory in the current working directory.
	

When creating temporary directories, it’s good practice to defer their removal. os.RemoveAll will delete a whole directory tree (similarly to rm -rf).
	

Helper function to create a new empty file.
	

We can create a hierarchy of directories, including parents with MkdirAll. This is similar to the command-line mkdir -p.
	



ReadDir lists directory contents, returning a slice of os.DirEntry objects.
	

Chdir lets us change the current working directory, similarly to cd.
	


Now we’ll see the contents of subdir/parent/child when listing the current directory.
	



cd back to where we started.
	

We can also visit a directory recursively, including all its sub-directories. Walk accepts a callback function to handle every file or directory visited.
	


visit is called for every file or directory found recursively by filepath.Walk.
