Writing a basic HTTP server is easy using the net/http package.


A fundamental concept in net/http servers is handlers. A handler is an object implementing the http.Handler interface. A common way to write a handler is by using the http.HandlerFunc adapter on functions with the appropriate signature.
	

Functions serving as handlers take a http.ResponseWriter and a http.Request as arguments. The response writer is used to fill in the HTTP response. Here our simple response is just “hello\n”.
	

This handler does something a little more sophisticated by reading all the HTTP request headers and echoing them into the response body.
	

We register our handlers on server routes using the http.HandleFunc convenience function. It sets up the default router in the net/http package and takes a function as an argument.

Finally, we call the ListenAndServe with the port and a handler. nil tells it to use the default router we’ve just set up.
	
Run the server in the background.


Access the /hello route.
