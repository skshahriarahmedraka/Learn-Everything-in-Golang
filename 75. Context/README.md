Go by Example: Context

In the previous example we looked at setting up a simple HTTP server. HTTP servers are useful for demonstrating the usage of context.Context for controlling cancellation. A Context carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and goroutines.

A context.Context is created for each request by the net/http machinery, and is available with the Context() method.
	

Wait for a few seconds before sending a reply to the client. This could simulate some work the server is doing. While working, keep an eye on the context’s Done() channel for a signal that we should cancel the work and return as soon as possible.
	

The context’s Err() method returns an error that explains why the Done() channel was closed.
