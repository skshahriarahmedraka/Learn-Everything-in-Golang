Go by Example: Time

Go offers extensive support for times and durations; here are some examples.

Weâ€™ll start by getting the current time.
	

You can build a time struct by providing the year, month, day, etc. Times are always associated with a Location, i.e. time zone.


You can extract the various components of the time value as expected.
	


The Monday-Sunday Weekday is also available.
	

These methods compare two times, testing if the first occurs before, after, or at the same time as the second, respectively.
	

The Sub methods returns a Duration representing the interval between two times.
	


We can compute the length of the duration in various units.
	

You can use Add to advance a time by a given duration, or with a - to move backwards by a duration.
