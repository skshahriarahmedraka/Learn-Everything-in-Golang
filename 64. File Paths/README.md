The filepath package provides functions to parse and construct file paths in a way that is portable between operating systems; dir/file on Linux vs. dir\file on Windows, for example.

	


Join should be used to construct paths in a portable way. It takes any number of arguments and constructs a hierarchical path from them.
	


You should always use Join instead of concatenating /s or \s manually. In addition to providing portability, Join will also normalize paths by removing superfluous separators and directory changes.
	



Dir and Base can be used to split a path to the directory and the file. Alternatively, Split will return both in the same call.


We can check whether a path is absolute.
	


Some file names have extensions following a dot. We can split the extension out of such names with Ext.
	



To find the fileâ€™s name with the extension removed, use strings.TrimSuffix.
	


Rel finds a relative path between a base and a target. It returns an error if the target cannot be made relative to base.
