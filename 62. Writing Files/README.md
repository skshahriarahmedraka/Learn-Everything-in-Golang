Writing Files

Writing files in Go follows similar patterns to the ones we saw earlier for reading.
	


To start, here’s how to dump a string (or just bytes) into a file.

For more granular writes, open a file for writing.


It’s idiomatic to defer a Close immediately after opening a file.
	


You can Write byte slices as you’d expect.
	


A WriteString is also available.


Issue a Sync to flush writes to stable storage.
	


bufio provides buffered writers in addition to the buffered readers we saw earlier.
	



Use Flush to ensure all buffered operations have been applied to the underlying writer.
	


Try running the file-writing code.


Then check the contents of the written files.
