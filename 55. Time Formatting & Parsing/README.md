Go supports time formatting and parsing via pattern-based layouts.
	

Here’s a basic example of formatting a time according to RFC3339, using the corresponding layout constant.
	


Time parsing uses the same layout values as Format.


Format and Parse use example-based layouts. Usually you’ll use a constant from time for these layouts, but you can also supply custom layouts. Layouts must use the reference time Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006 to show the pattern with which to format/parse a given time/string. The example time must be exactly as shown: the year 2006, 15 for the hour, Monday for the day of the week, etc.
	


For purely numeric representations you can also use standard string formatting with the extracted components of the time value.
	



Parse will return an error on malformed input explaining the parsing problem.
